Toly or Tholy, who died in 1500, go back to 1460.2
Nicholas Newman, who was one of the friars who signed
the Deed of Surrender in 153 8, occurs in 1521.3 The
significance of new dates in the cases of Allen, Bavard,
Cutler‚ Kyrye, and Standish has already been noted.

On 14 August, 1 572, there was buried at Christchurch‚
Newgate Street, one‘ '‘'John Baker, an old priest who died
in S. Bartholomew' s.' '4 There 1s no difficulty 1n identi-
fying him with‘ ‘John Bardlmewe, clerk and bachelor
1n divinite,'' who two years before, on 10 August, 1570,
had made his will “ sigillatum et subscriptum per me
Johannem Baker.'' 5 Bartilmewe gave direction that he
should be ‘⁴ buried in the Gray ffreres Cloyster in the
parishe of Christ Churche, over against the Scoolehouse
dore ther‚'’ and in order that the Treasurer or Master of
Christ's Hospita] might consent to give licence for his
burial in that place left 205. to the children of the Hos—
pital. This leaves no room for doubt that the old priest
was the Friar John Baker who had signed the Deed of
Surrender in 1538. 6 Clearly he had kept his love for
his ancient home, and though we cannot tell whether his
wish was fulfilled he certainly found his last resting- -place
within its precincts. From the position of his name in the
list of 1 5 38 Baker was probably not a very young man
at that time, and was no doubt old when he died. Some
of his brethren might easily have survived him, but so far
he is the last of the Grey Friars of London of whom we
have knowledge. It is possible that for some reason he
had found it prudent to change his name, though
Bartilmewe may have been only an alternative derived
from his place of residence.
