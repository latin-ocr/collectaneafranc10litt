· The Gospel Harmony of John de Cautibus 17

¹ in four MSS. known to the writer. Three of these agree
exactly,1 and have small verba] differences from the

other, which appears, however, to be the earliest,2 written
between 1 389 and c. 1400. This one begins :

The tyme commynge and neghynge of pe reuthes and mercyes
of the lord, in wiche tyme he ordanede his pepil safe, and also to
again bye n03t wt corruptible golde ne syluer, bot wt hys precious
blude3 he wald also make a worthy and noble soper with his
discipils‚ before he wald departe fro pam be deth, in to a memoriall
sygne of recorde, and also pat pai schulde fulfill pe mysterys pat
was to be fulfilled; for soth pis soper was ful praysabill‚ and of grete
mystery wer 190 thyngis pat crist ihesus dide at thys tyme‚ etc.

One or two fifteenth-century manuscripts have partial
translations of the Passion in southern prose, which may
be portions of the above- mentioned southern translation,
or may be independent fragments. 3 Two other late
fourteenth— —century manuscripts have an independent
translation of another part of the Meditationes—the portion

dealing with the life of our Lady.4
All these translations were certainly earlier than that

of Nicholas Love, which was the first to cover, though
in an abridged form, the whole ground of the Meditationes.
It became so popular that it naturally tended to oust the
earlier translations, and to render fresh ones unnecessary.

1 Caius 669 and Laud Misc. 23, having as incipit ε “ The tyme ney3ing
and comyng of pe myseracions and mercyes of pe lorde,’' and Bodl. 789,
incipit: “ Pe tyme nei3yng and comynge to of ]9e pite and merci of Pe
lorde.’' All three were written between 1400 and 14 50, and end with the-

Begessssitgf-Camb· 322, f. 328b. It is difficult to tell without complete

collation whether this text is independent of that of the other three MSS. ς
but it covers exactly the same portion of the Meditationes, and appears to be
merely a variant.

3 Laud Misc. 174, f. 69. ‘⁶ Meditacioun of pingis doon after pe deep
of crist. Bonauenture. FerPermore oure blissid ladye and hir blissid
felouship Per togider sittynge under pe cros ” (cf. Horstmann, i, 208).
This also ends with the Benedictus. Egerton 2658 is probably indepen-
dent : incipit ι “ Our lord Jesus when he was xxx years old he made hise
apostles '⁷3 f. 1 gb: “ Explicit liber aureus de passione et resurrectione
Domini, per dominum Bonaventuram, Cardinalem.’'

4 Harl. 1022, Bodl. 938 ; cf. 1609 ed„ vi, 336.
