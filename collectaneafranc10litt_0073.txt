³ V. Additional Material for the History of the
Grey Fria‘rS, London. By C. L. Kingsford.

INTRODUCTION

HE principa] part of the additional material for
Ι the history of the Grey Friars of London comes
from the wills of persons who were buried 1n the
Church and 1ts precincts. Most of these wills were proved
in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury‚ but a consider-
able number come from the Registers of the Commissary
of London and the Archdeacon of London, and a few
from other sources.1 The wills from the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury it is believed include all the wills of
persons buried at Grey Friars, together with a few others
which, for one reason or another, appeared to be of
sufficient interest to be noticed here. There are, in
addition, a great number of wills in which the testators
made bequests to the Friars for masses, · but to trace and
notice all these latter wills would have entailed labour
entirely out of proportion to the value of any probable
result3 in ‘Ro''us alone Mr. A. G. Little has noted
more than twenty instances‚ and the total number between
1390 and 1540 would probably be several hundred. It
is not possible in the absence of a printed calendar to be
certain whether the selection of wills from the Registers
of the Commissary of London and the Archdeacon of
London is equally exhaustive. But those from the Com-
missary's Register are probably complete, whilst the
Register of the Archdeacon for 1393 to 141 5 is the only
one before the Reformation which has been preserved.
Of the names here recorded nearly one half do not
appear in the Grey Friars Register. Of these the greater
number are of early date, and are of persons of little socia]
importance whose tombs had probably been destroyed
before the Register was compiled.2 Other names—like that

1 For many of the references other than to P.C.C. I am indebted to
Mr. J Challenor Smsth, F .S.A.‚ who has kindly put his extensive collec-
tions at my disposal.

2 Out of the first fifty wills noted here (1374—1421) only sixteen are of
persons whose names appear in the Register.
