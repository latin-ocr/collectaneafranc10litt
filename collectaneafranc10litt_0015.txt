Documents at C anterbury Relating to the Grey Friars 3

From the above agreement it will be observed that
within the ambit of the Friars were certain tenements
which belonged to the Prior and Convent of Christ
Church, and for which rents were paid, namely, for that
formerly held by Samuel the Dyer, 7ssd. 3 that formerly
held by Berenger in Wytht, 12d. 3 for that held by the
same in Ottemed, 5d. ; for that formerly held by Serona
of Boughton, 6d.; for the rent of Wibert,1 formerly
Prior of Christ Church, near Ottewell,12d.; and for the
tenement of Stephen, son of Lewin Sainuel, Ι 8d.; a total
of 55. 04 ld, and there were evidently arrears owing. The
Prior and Convent agreed to remit all the arrears due to
them, regarding2 it as a charity: on condition that the
Friars' proctors2 paid into their treasury a yearly rent

2. Amongst the series of Christ Church Letters 1n manu-
script, and inscribed‘ ‘Correspondence of Prior Henry of
Eastry '' [128 5-1 322], is a letter without endorsement or
date, addressed to the Prior, advising him not to confirm
the grant of land to the Franciscans, who, supported by
Edmund, the King's brother, are about to build a house
in Lambeth 3 as in course of time such a settlement might

be prejudicial to the interests of the Churches of Canter-
bury and Rochester.

The letter is written on a strip of parchment ’γὲ ''by 21”
it occupies eleven close lines of very small script, and
has been injured by damp. The Press Mark 15· MSS.
Ch. Ch. Letters II, 67. The date must fall between 128 5

(Eastry' 5 accession) and 1296 (Edmund' 5 death), perhaps
during the vacancy after Peccham' s death (Dec. 8, Ι 292).

3. Another document amongst the archives of the
Dean and Chapter—F. 1 52-is a covenant dated 8 June,
