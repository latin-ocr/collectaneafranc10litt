John Boston and the Kindred Documents 47

From Ιὲετε to 150 the references are exceedingly
sparse, an

136 Louth Park,137 Grimsby, 140 F ountalns 141 Bardney,
144 Whitby‚ 146 Kirkham, 147 Spalding, 148 Thornholm,
149 Carlisle—all seem to be blank.

Boston omits of his own additions ε

171 Thetford Austin Friars (?)
172 Thetford Priory.
195 Hinton Charterhouse.

The omissions of the lists themselves also merit a
word. We have seen that houses of Friars are included
only by Boston‚ and only four by him. It will be noticed
that neither of the Universities and no College is men-
tioned. Of Cathedrals‚ York, Lichfield, and the four
Welsh ones seem to be the only omissions, Other
Collegiate churches and non-monastic establishments are
absent, unless Bakewell and the Hospitals of Lincoln
are exceptions. But of monasteries we miss a number of
well-known names ε Abbotsbury, Abergavenny, Belvoir,
Bermondsey, Blythe, Bolton‚ Bourn, Bromholme‚ Byland,
Chertsey, Dover, Haughmond, Hayles, Kirkstall, Lesnes,
Malvern, Meaux, Milton, Nedey, Salley, Selby, Shaftes-
bury (nuns), Tavistock‚ Walsingham, Welbeck‚ Whalley,
Winchcombe, Worksop were all far more important
than many of those included in the list ς they are not con-
fined to one district, but are scattered up and down the
country. Conjectures as to the reason of the omissions
are useless at this stage.

Only when we have the full texts of the three docu-
ments before us shall we be able to trace the method in
which the lists of books from the various monasteries
were used. At present the observations that can be made
are elementary. There 1s no geographica] order or any
other sort of order perceptible 1n the library references 1n
R. and T. The commonest beginning appears to be one
of the numbers about 1 60: 1 63 Newminster perhaps has
a majority. Another group sets off with No. 1 Canterbury
Cathedral. Boston‚ who, as I have said, gives fewer
