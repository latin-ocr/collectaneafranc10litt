Documents at Canterbury Relating to tlte Grey Friars 5

between 1285 and 1298, asking for the appointment or
reappointment of Friar Ralph, of Wydeheye or Wodehay,
as their lector. 1 The practice was continued until 1314,
when the monks wrote to the Provincia] Chapter that
they no longer required the services of their Franciscan
lector, Robert of Fulham, as his pupils were now com-
petent to fill his place.2

The first of the four letters here printed is in answer
to one of the letters of the Prior and Convent asking for
the reappointment of Ralph of Wodehay e. It 1s written
by‘ ‘.W, Provincia] Minister,’ ' i. e., Wyilliam of Gains-
borough, who was elected Provincia] 1n 128 5, probably
at the Provincial Chapter at Cambridge, and ceased to
hold office in 1292. The letter is dated “ Nottingham
on the Saturday after the Assumption of the glorious
Virgin.” The feast of the Assumption was the date on
which the Provincial Chapter was usually held, and it is
certainly to this assembly that the phrase “ in hac nostra
congregatione '‘ refers. The document is, therefore, a
record of a Provincia] Chapter, and as such is a great
rarity. It is an original, and not a copy3 it measures
2⁵s8⁰ by 7 ¹''s3 ‚ and shows no signs of sealing. The year is
probably 1286. Provincia] Chapters were held 1n 128 5
at Cambridge, 1287 London, 1288 Lincoln, 1289
Oxford, and 1 292 Cambridge.3 The place of the Chapter
in 1286, 1290, and 1291 is at present unknown. The
earliest of these dates is the most probable for this letter,
because the reappointment of Friar Ralph would have
become more of a matter of course by 1290.4 The
letter exhibits a most exaggerated form of “ Friars'
Rhetoric '² in the art of letter-writing. Whether the style
is due to the eloquence of William of Gainsborough or
the traditions of the Provincia] Minister's office is

Bridge, near Canterbury, in 1287, but he was certainly not our friar.
