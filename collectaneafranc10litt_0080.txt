buried in the 3rd bay of the north aisle towards the south—
west corner. In the same bay but a little further east lay
William Gee, who was buried in 148 5. Both Hoton and
Gee were to be buried “ coram imagine beate Marie '’ ;
the position of this Image may possibly have been on the
east side of the 3rd column. Baldwin Payne in 1463
directed that he should be buried in the north part of
the church “ coram imagine beate Marie de Graciis '' 3
the position of his tomb is unknown—the Image may
perhaps be the one referred to by Hoton. In 141 1 David
Bardevyle directed that he should be buried before the
Image of the Virgin in the south part of the church 3 the
position of the tomb is again unknown, but the Image is
clearly distinct from Hoton's. Joan Golding, who died
in 1464, desired to be buried before the Image of Our
Lady, and George Belton in 1473 was to be buried in
the Nave before the Image of Blessed Mary commonly
called of Maurice Poyns. The positions of the tombs are
again unknown, but the Images may perhaps be identified
with either Hoton's or Bardevyle's. Margaret Yonge in
1501 was to be buried “ afore the ymage of our Lady
within the valens ”3 she lay immediately within the
screen before the Jesus Altar; this Image might be the
same as Bardevyle’s or Golding’s, though Bardevyle's
was more probably in the Nave proper. The fifth Image
was in the Chapel of S. Mary3 Joan Elveden in 1421
left a circlet of silver-gilt set with gems to be placed on
the head of the Virgin‚ where her body lay buried 3 her
tomb was in the 5th bay of the Choir in S. Mary's
Chapel. In 1464 Maud Lawrence directed that she
should be buried near the High Altar before the Image
of Blessed Mary ; the position of her tomb is not known,
but it is unlikely that it was in the high choir, and the
reference is probably to Joan Elveden's Image.

There was an Image of S. Francis near the High
Altar, to which reference is made in the will of the Duchess
of Buckingham in 1531. The Image of S. Bernardine
in the Lady Chapel has already been mentioned.l An
