History of the Grey Friars, London 67

Richard Hallam in 141 9 directed that he should be buried
opposite the window of S. Christopher, which is fixed
by the position of his tomb to be the 5th window from
the east in the north aisle of the Nave. The same window
is described in 1473, by Robert Orchard, as having been
set up by his grandfather, Thomas Cavendish, who

the Church. Alexander Crayke in 1465 desired to be
buried before the Cross in the body of the Church. In
fifteen wills there are references to Images of the Virgin,
of which there must have been at least five. In six
instances the reference is clearly to Our Lady of Pity,
which from the Register would seem to have been set
up by John Arnold‚ who died in 1492 and was buried
under the wall against the first part of the 3rd window
in the north aisle of the Nave.1 From the position of his
tomb it would be natural to conjecture that the image was
against the wall between the 2nd and 3rd windows. But
the will of Alice Lucas in 1524 makes it clea'r that the
Image of Our Lady of Pity stood on the right hand of the
entry to the Altar of S. Mary. This is confirmed by the
wills of Gilbert Belamy in 1498, Robert White in 1 52 1,
and William Thomas in 1 5 30. Lucas, Belamy, White,
and Thomas all lay within a short distance of this point,
and Ralph Hudson was buried in 1494 on the south side
of this bay.2 The sixth will which makes mention of
Our Lady of Pity is that of John a Cleton in 1505 ; but
in his case we do not know the position of the tomb.
There was another Image of the Virgin in the north aisle„
which is mentioned in the will of William Hoton in 1447 ς,
Hoton is probably the person of that name who was

1 Grey Fran-5, p. 1 19. This is, of course, the second window west of
the Altars. I assume that Arnold's Image was Our Lady of Pity. It does
not seem likely that there would have been two Images of the Virgin close
together at this end of the Aisle, and the Register seems to mark Arnold’s
Image as one of special note.

2 Grey Friars, pp. 117-19. It will be noted that the references to

Our Lady of Pity are all of later date than the death of John Arnold.
