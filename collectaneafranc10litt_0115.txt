History of tlze Grey Frzhrs, London 103

ecclesia Fratrum Minorum‚ London, prope summum'
altare coram ymagine beate Marie ibidem.'’ Left 65. 8d.
for her burial, and to each friar priest 6d. and to each
other friar 4d.

Will dated 5 April, 1464. Proved 7 May, 1464.
Comm. Lond„ Sharp‚ f. 357.

The Image of S. Mary here named may, perhaps, be that in the

Chapel of S. Mary (see p. 68 above). It does not seem likely that
Maud Lawrence could have contemplated burial in the High Choir.

1464. *RICHARD MYLLER, brewer. To be buried
within the Church of the Friars Minors “secundum
directionem magistri mei Gardiani eiusdem domus.''

Will dated 22 Sept„ 1464—“ tercio anno Regis
Edwardi.'' Proved 6 Sept„ 1464. Comm. Lond., Sharp,

Myller was presumably the brewer at Greyfriars. The date

“ Mcccclxiiij ” given for his Will is shown to be an error by the
addition of the regnal year.

1465. ALEXANDER CRAYKE. To be buried in the
Church of the Friars Minors, London, “scilicet ante
crucem in corpore eiusdem ecclesie,'' if he died in
London3 or otherwise at Beverley. If he was buried
here the Friars were to have 35. 4d.

Will dated 6 July‚ 1465. Proved 12 Nov., 1465.
Comm. Lond„ Sharp, f. 376.

Since Crayke's Will was proved in the Commissary of Lon-
don’s Court‚ he may be identified with the Greyke of the Register.

Grey Friars, p. 1 15. For the cross in the Nave see the Will of
Walter Potter in 1459.

1465. ³¹⁶ THOMAS CREYKE‚ son of Alexander Creyke, of
Beverley. If he died in London he desired to be buried in
the Chul-ch of the Friars Minors there.

See Testamenta Eboracensz'cz, iv, 34 (Surtees Society).

Honey Lane. ‘⁴ To the Covent of the hous of the freres
