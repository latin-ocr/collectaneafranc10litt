careful; but in Elizabeth Copley’s direction that she
was to be prayed for ‘⁴ according to the laudable custome
and use'' there is perhaps a conscious echo of change.
One feature in the wills which grows more common
towards the latter part of the period is the direction that
the Friars were to fetch the body to burial, either from
the home of the dead or from the parish church where a

from his parish church. Otl'iers are those of Joan
Golding in 1464, Roger Spencer 1n 1492, and William
Gage and Thomas Butside 1n 1497. The will of John
Robynson in Ι 51 1 is an interesting and exceptional
instance, since his home was at Battersea and the corpse
was to be brought by water to Broken Wharf, where it
was to be met by the four orders of Friars and the priests
of Pappey. The ordinary payment to include “ fetching ''
seems to have been 405. 3 though Richard Parys in 148 3
paid only 65. 8d. for burial, and 6s. 8d. for fetching,
dirige and requiem 3 and Thomas Hewett in 1533 paid
65. Sd. for fetching. The attendance of Friars at funerals
was, of course, usual. Thomas Cornton in 1410 left
each of the Friars that bore him to the church 1 2d. John
Pette in 1522 willed that the Grey Friars and Black
Friars should be at his burying, ‘⁴ for I arn a brother of
either religion.’' James Wylford in 1527, though, like
Pette, he was not buried at Grey Friars, left 405. to the
Friars to come to his burying and to say placebo, dirige,
and mass in their own church Similar 1nstances are those
of Richard Triplarde 1n 1498 and Richard Hanchett 1n
1526. The priests of Pappey are often associated with
the Friars in this service} It is remarkable that no
reference to the Third Order occurs in these wills.

The provision for tombs and tombstones is, of course,

memoration it may be noted that the Craft of Purcers had a solemn mass
yearly at Greyfriars, on Trinity Sunday, when every brother was to offer
a penny and every sister a halfpenny. Letter Book, L, p. 2 5 3.
