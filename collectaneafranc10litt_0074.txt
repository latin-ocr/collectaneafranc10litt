sons whose intention to be buried here was not fulfilled.
A few names are of later date than the compilation of the
Register. In a few cases where the Register gave no date
the date can now be supplied. Some of these, like John
Portland 1n 1490, were additions, and so conjecturally of
later date than 1529.1 They now become evidence of
the care bestowed on the perfectiori of the Register.

The completion of the Register might be regarded as
the primary purpose of such a list as that here g1ven.
But, however interesting from one point of view the
completion of the Register might be, the real value of
these extracts lies in other directions. One may naturally
give the first place to the information which they afford
as to the actual burials and the attendant services. There
was no doubt a fixed charge for a burial, and Thomas
Huddylston‚ in 1506, directed that ‘⁴ such certain duty

Hevysonne in 1493 ; the last-named left 65. 8d. “ for my
pit to be had.'’ This seems to have been the common fee
in other London churches during the fifteenth century.
But, of course, larger sums were often paid to secure the
prayers of the Friars, ranging from 205. upwards, to
include the actual burial3 twenty shillings was perhaps
the normal payment for burial, dirige and mass of
requiem.2 Persons of rank and wealth left much larger

choir in 1386, left the Friars 4ol. ; Sir John Devereux
in 1393 directed that 40 marks should be paid “ pur
mon sepulture '' ; William Chamberleyn in 1470 left 5ί.

Sir John Clerk in 148 1 left the Friars 4l. ; and Sir John
Blount in 1485 left zol„ besides a chalice and a vestment.
All these seem to have been bequests without any special
condition. Other large bequests were to secure the
