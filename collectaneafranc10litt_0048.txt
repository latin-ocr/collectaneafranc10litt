36 Historical I nterpretation os the Apocalypse

wrote Commentarii in Apocalypsin (Bibl. Lat. Med. et Inf.
Aetatis, i, p. 60); although the addition “inter scholasticos
saeculi xv, doctor illibatus '² would seem to be inconsistent
with the date of our treatise. In reality these scholastic
titles belong rather to the thirteenth and fourteenth than
to the fifteenth century, as Sbaralea points out in his
Supplement to Wadding's Work.
