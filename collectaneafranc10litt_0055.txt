to this place in the list. Berkshire belongs to the next
Custody, that of Oxford.

In Oxon. 54 Cheleford is a very obscure place, doubtless
Shelford in Notts.

60 Banchewelle Sankwale, Bankewale, Blanchewelle‚
Ι had thought was Bakewell, but no trace of a monastic
or collegiate establishment there can I find In default,
Sandwell (O. S. Β. priory, Staffs. ) is suggested. However,
the only authority for the initial S is 3 D Ι, which is the
least trustworthy of all.

61 Burgh, Burch. Something has been said of this.
I am sure that R. intended Peterborough, and I think it
can be shown that this was Boston’ s usual name for
Peterborough. What T. understood by it is uncertain.
A house Brooke in Rutland, to which S. Tibba’s bones
were translated, is possible. It was an Augustinian
priory, a cell to Kenilworth.

I see nothing to remark upon in Cambridge, but atten-
tion should be called, in Bristol, to 102 S. Augustini pre
bristoll (3 D Ι). The preposition pre may be wrong for
prope, or may have no business there. Peterhouse omits it.

10 5 Clamorgan I have little hesitation in equating with
Margam, but I suppose Neath, not far off, is a possibility.

109 Lanton, Lantonia, is, of course, the New Llan-
thony in the outskirts of Gloucester, which has contri-
buted so large a number of its MSS. to the Lambeth
Librar .

In sporcesoerit is curious to see 1 1 2 S.WolstanusWigorn
as the name of the Cathedral, the main dedication of which
is to the Virgin. It reads like a popular description,
almost a nickname, of the church. The Hospital of S.
Wulfstan, now the Commandery, cannot be supposed to
have been preferred to the Cathedral whose library was so
remarkable.

1 20 Planagustell, Planegustel is one of the most curious
of the orthographies. Llanegwast or Llanegwist, alias
de Valle Crucis, in Denbigh, answers all the conditions.
Tne initial P may be an attempt to render the sound of
Welsh ll : I do not know whether there are parallels to this.
