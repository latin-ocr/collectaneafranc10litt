John Boston and the Kindred Documents 41

was being employed, was set going before the mistake
was discovered.
The next discrepancy affects Nos. 61 to 66 :

Burgh 61 Burgh 61 Burch 61
Turney 62 Thorneye 62 Thorneye 62
Crowland 63 Crowlande 63 Croylande 63
Burgus S. Petri Burgus S. Petri 64 (om)

Custodia Cantebregg Cantabrigg (om)
Bernewelle 64 Bernewelle 65 Bernewelle 64
Rammesey 65 Ramseye 66 Ramesia 65
Ely 67 Hely 67 Ely 67

The confusion starts with 61. Whatever R. and T.
meant by this, it is evident that Boston took it to mean
Peterborough. But R. inserts Peterborough after Crow-
land (63), yet gives it no number. T. inserts it and gives
it a number, 643 Boston discards both name and number.
Hence confusion.

No. 64 ιη R. and B. =Barnwell z in T. Peterborough.

65 in R. and B. =Ramsey : in T. Barnwell.

66 is omitted by R. and B. t in T. Ramsey.

67 in all=Ely.
I guess here that Burgus S. Petri was originally an ex-
planatory gloss on Burgh, and crept into the text at the
end of the section. Assuming R. to be the earliest of the
authorities, I also guess that T. found both ‘Burgh and
Burgus S. Petri in its list and supplied what it supposed
to be an omitted number. B„ with a better text before
him, or more alert 1n mind, was not deceived. But why
R. and B. unite in omitting the number 66 I do not see.
It is no less and no more liable to confusion than any other
number of which the two digits are the same, 33, 44, ete.
The number 100 is omitted in all three lists, Ι suppose
because it was liable to be misread or misinterpreted as 1 0.

The next mistake affects Nos. 104, 10 5 :

Malmgsoeria 1 03 Malmegberia 1 0 3 ΜᾶΙηιεῖῗ6εΓῐ3, 1 03
Sirencestr’ 1 05 Curucestria 1 04 Cirencestria 1 04
