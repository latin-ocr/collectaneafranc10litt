factors‚ xx s.''

Will dated 1 July, 1527. Proved 30 Jan.‚ 1538-9.
24 Dyngeley.

The Will was not proved till after the Surrender, but Inglish had
probably been dead some years. He was alderman of Coleman

Street ward from 1524 to 1531. He and his wife may probably be
identified with the Michael and Margaret Inglyshe who were
buried in the second bay of the North Aisle of the Nave. The
Register gives the date of Margaret's death as 23 January, 1507.
