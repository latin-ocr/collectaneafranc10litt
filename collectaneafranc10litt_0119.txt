The Image of Our Lady, commonly called Maurice Poyns‚ may
possibly be the same with one of those named in the Wills of David

Bardevyle in 141 1, or Joan Golding in 1464 (see p. 102 above).
There appears to be no other reference to Maurice Poyns.

14 Wattys.

Preston’ 3 name does not appear in the Register. But the terms of

the Will make it clear that by“ minoresse ” the Grey Friars are
intended. The list of books is rather remarkable for a layman.
