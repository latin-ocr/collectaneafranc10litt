Churches or Orders to which they belonged, as well as

their University degrees.)

7. Register O contains a few notes on the Friars
Mirm-,1 The Register is one of two small thick parch-
ment volumes which at one time seem to have formed
a single register but were bound as two during the first
half of the 18th century. With a few exceptions the
entries were all made at the end of the 13th or beginning
of the 14th centuries in the days of Prior Henry of Eastry
(1285-1322). The following memoranda relating to the
Friars were inserted in blank spaces in the Ι 5th century ε

(a) fol. 404f. A quotation from W. of Malmesbury . . . With
the reference : Malmysburiensis in fine primi libri sui, qui liber
est in conventu Fratrum Minorum Cantuar’ qui intitulatur sic:
Notabilia super ecclesiasticam historiam et tripartitum cum
extractionibus Willelmi Malmesbyry’, et habens in dorso super

ligamento tales figuras P. i h.

(b) fol. 407V3 Anno dominice incarnacionis millesimo cc⁰
vicesimo quarto intraverunt fratres minorum in Angliam et benigne
a rege Henrico sunt suscepti et Cantuar’ collocati fuerunt in
Wyht: et London' apud Cornhelle.

(c) ibid. Anno dominice incarnacionis millesimo ec01xvij

et locum porte super Stour strete ad opus Fratrum Minorum et
tempore oportuno transtulit fratres in illam.2

(d) ibid. Anno dominice incarnationis millesimo cc0xxvj⁰beatus
pater F ranciscus Christi Jesu signaculis insignitus presens exillium
exiens celesti consorcio sociatur et sic fratres minorum Angliam
intraverunt per biennium ante mortem beati F rancisci.

8. Register Q, fol. xiiis, mentions amongst those
present at Mortlake at the death of Archbishop Peccham,
in December 1292, John de Beverle, guardian, and John
de Ravenestone‚ both ‘⁴ de ordine minorum.’'

1 Cf. Hist. MSS. Com. Rep.‚ 1x,i‚ 108.

2 This is evidently the source of Leland's notes in Collectanea‚ vol. iv,
p. Ι 17 (ed. Hearne). He, however, reads ‘⁴ ΑΛ). 1269 et anno sequenti ’'
(for 1267), and ‘⁶ Stonestrete ’' (for Stourstrete). Stourstrete is close to
the Franciscan Convent: Stone Street is the Roman road leading from
Wincheape to Lympne.
