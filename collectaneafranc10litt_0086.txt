what we know of his previous history it is very unlikely
that he was Guardian before Cutler's first term. From
about 1440 onwards (and possibly earlier) the Guardians
would seem to have held office for extended periodS, and
it is probable that the list of the later Guardians is com-
plete, with the exception of the one between Kyrye’s
two termsl and perhaps his immediate successor.

As regards Friars of the London House the List of
1460 furnishes us with 22 new names and a date for
four others for whom we had only the names. The wills
and other documents supply 1 9 new names and the dates
for two undated„ For a number of other F riars there are
additional dates, which are sometimes of interest or
importance.

The new names, in alphabetical order, are as follows ε

Antony of Cologne, 1460.

John Billyk, 1460 ; Thomas Bolton‚ 1460 3 John
Boosgawyn (Boscawen), 1460 3 William Browe, 1 38 5 2 ;
Robert Brown, 1460.

William Carpenter‚ 14603 Gerald de Crugiacha‚3 141 3.

Richard Elderden, 14603 John Eversham, 1460.

William Fabri‚4 1390.

2 Will of Hugh Mason.

3 Will of Gaillard Denbidan, of Bordeaux.

gueux in 1401 (Cal. Pap. Reg., v, 454).

5 Will of John Halman.

⁶ Will of Paschasius de Ilardia of Navarre ε describes F riar Giles as his

Guardian of Oxford in 1515 (Little‚ Grey Friars in Oxford, p. 131).
