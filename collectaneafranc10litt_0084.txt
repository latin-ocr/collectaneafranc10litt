Guardians. 1 We now know that John Kyryewas Guardian
as late as 1460. We are told that he was Guardian
“interpellatim per viginti annos.'' Perhaps the most
likely meaning of this is that he actually held the office
for twenty years, but with one or more intervals.2 He was
certainly Guardian in 1440, and perhaps a year or two
earlier. Kyrye may have retained the office for some
little time after 146ος he 1s referred to in the will of John
Aleyn on 4 August, 146 3 simply as “magistrum
Johannem Kyrry, sacre theologie doctorem'' but
neither this nor the reference by William Gregory 1n 146 5
to‘ ‘frere kiry, frere menour is conclusive that he was
not Guardian 1n 1463 or 1465 However, it is not likely
that he retained the office till his death m 1474.

In the list of Guardians I conjectured that James Walle
might have succeeded Kyrye. Walle was consecrated
Bishop of Kildare on 5 April, 1475, and his tenure of
office as Guardian must no doubt be put either before
or after that date. We now know that he was Guardian
at some time between 1475 and 1480, the period during
which Thomas Rotherham was Bishop of Lincoln and
Chancellor, with a possible alternative for 148 3- 5, when
John Russell was Bishop of Lincoln and Chancellor.3
Since Walle held various livings from 1483 onwards,
and was suffragan of London in 1491, it is probable that
the extreme limits of his term were 1476 and 1483.
Thus, however, there must have been a Guardian between
Kyrye and Walle. John Allen is referred to in his
father's will in 1463 as “ in sacra theologia inceptorem, '’
and by John Baldewyne 1n 1469 as ‘Magister doctor
Johannes Aleyn. ’' It 1s possible that he may have pre-
ceded Walle, though having regard to his standing 1n
1463 it is more likely that he was not Guardian till after
1480. He had probably vacated his office before his
death, since he is described as “ quondam gardianus ''

² If it meant twenty years including intervals‚ 1440 and 1460 would

be the extreme limits of date.
