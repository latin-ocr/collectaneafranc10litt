The Gospel Harmony of John de Caulibus 19

of ownership in the manuscripts one is that of the friar
James of Parma, who wrote and owned a complete
Latin manuscript of the iMeditationes in 14 541 The first
translation was, I believe, certainly intended to be read
aloud, or recited, as a sermon in church: probably not
as the sermon at mass, but at some special preaching in
holy week. The translator's prologue begins:

Alle my3ty god yn trynyte

Now and euer wyp vs be 3

For py sones passyun

Saue alle pys congregacyun 3

And graunte vs grace of gode lyuying
To wynne vs blysse wypouten endyng.
Now euery man, yn hys degre

Sey amen, amen, pur charyte.

This makes it clear that the translation was not made,
for instance, for some English nunnery, or Poor Clare,
but was meant to be recited to a “ congregation '’ as con-
temporary romances were recited on some secular
occasion. The northern verse gospels and homilies were
possibly meant to be similarly recited in church. Cer-
tainly Wycliffe repeatedly accused the friars of intro-
ducing novelties in their manner of preaching, and,
specifically, of preaching in rhyme-2 The general
Franciscan provenance of the Meditationes suggests that
some Franciscan friar was the author of this earliest verse
translation, but the point cannot be pressed further.
Of the later translations, apart from the connection of the
Privity with Richard Rolle or some follower, and the
translation of Nicholas Love, there is no evidence for
authorship. But of their popularity there can be no doubt.

lation in Trin. Camb. 61) was Edward Bochyng‚ of Canterbury College.

2 Lollard Bible (Deanesly, M.) 148, 149. A good example of a rhymed
sermon of the early fourteenth century is the ‘⁴ Sarmun‚” printed in
Heuser’s K ildare-Gedicbte (Bonn, 1904), pp. 89-96. Even in the fifteenth
century, when rhymewas less often used for purposes of instruction, Mirk‚ in
his F estival‚ quoted, in one sermon, forty—eight lines of rhyme expressly for
repetition by the people; see Manna! of the Writings in Middle English
(Wells, J. E.)‚ 1916, p. 303.
