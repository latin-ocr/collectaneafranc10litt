This Will, though not proved for some years after, was made
just over a year before the Smrender, and appears to be the
latest Will with 3 bequest for the Friars. Her husband, William
Lego, had been buried in the Church in 1530. Ann Lego was
apparently a woman of considerable wealth. At her death she was
resident within the precinct of the Grey Friars, and her husband may
also have resided there. John Marsham does not appear amongst

the Friars who signed the Surrender in 1538. Grey Friars‚ pp.
