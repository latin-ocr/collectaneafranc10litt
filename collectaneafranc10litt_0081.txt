History of the Grey Friars, London ’ 69

Image of S. Christopher is mentioned in the wills of
Richard Covyntre in 1406 and James Gyfford in 147 3 3
in neither case is the position of the tomb known3 possibly
the Image was in the same bay of the North Aisle as the
window of S. Christopher. William Hoton in 1447
directed that he should be buried in the North Aisle
before the Images of the Blessed Mary and S. James3
his tomb was in the 3rd bay. Hugh Acton in 1530
directed that he should be buried before the picture
of S. Mary Magdalen in the South Aisle of the Choir3
his tomb was in the 6th bay in S. Francis Chapel. In
1474 Thomas Dagworthe directed that he should be
buried “ on the north side . . . before the Image of S.
Erasmus '' 3 in 1 5 3 3 Thomas Hewett was to be buried
in the Nave, where there was ‘⁴ a tablet of S. Erasmus on
the north side as you come out of the west door.'' In
both the reference was probably to the same object, which
from Hewett‘s description would seem to be one of the
alabaster tablets which were so noteworthy a product of
English art in the fifteenth century3 the martyrdom of
S. Erasmus was a favourite subject for these tablets.1

Bequests of vestments or of the material for vestments
are, of course, not infrequent. Instances are those of Alice
Fitz Rauff in 1471, Richard Kesteyn in 1473, Walter,
Lord Mountjoy‚ in 1474, his son, Sir John Blount, in
1485, and Elizabeth Uvedale in 1488. John Crowland
in 1485 left a banner cloth for the Cross, and William
Brereton in 1488 an altar cloth for the Common Altar.
The most noteworthy bequests of jewels are those by
Joan Elveden in 1421 of a circlet for the Image of the
Virgin, and by Lawrence Fyncham of a jewel worth
6l. 135. 4d. in 1481. Alice Fitz Rauff in 1471 left her
silver candlesticks, Elizabeth Uvedale in 1488 a chalice
and two cruets of silver for the Altar of S. Mary, and
William Kebyll in 1510 a mazer, the last-named being in
part payment for his tomb.

References to buildings other than the church are,
perhaps naturally, not very frequent. There are several
