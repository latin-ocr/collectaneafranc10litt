1500-1. 20 Moone.

The ‘⁴ valens” was probably the screen between the Altars and
the Nave. Margaret Yonge's tomb was immediately within the
screen, before the Jesus Altar, which was on the south side 3 having
regard to the explicit terms of the Will, it would seem that this was
where she intended to be buried, and consequently that there was
an Image of the Virgin there. This Will contains what is perhaps

the only definite reference to the “ Ostrye '⁹ or guest—house. Friar
Ralph Hasilden is mentioned only here. Grey Friars, pp. Ι 1 O, 237.

1501. STEPHEN KELK, citizen and goldsmith. To be
buried in the Church of the Grey Friars of London.
“ To the friers to fett my body to my sepulture and for
my burienge ther to be had ’' 405„ and for a trental of
masses 105. ‘⁴ I bequeth xxvj s. viij d. for a marble
stone to be ordeyned by my executours to ley on my
grave.''

Will dated 10 June, 1500. Proved 28 July, 1501.

Probably the Stephen Kelke who was buried in the centre of the
sixth bay of the Choir in the Chapel of S. Mary with his wives
Katherine and Joan. The Register has the date of death 7 July,
1415, probably an error for 1501 3 but there is no mention of his

wives in the Will. Another Will was not proved till 1511, but
seems to belong to the same Stephen Kelk. Grey Friars, p. 85.

1502. THoMAs GRAYSON. “ Oon of the wrecches of
this worlde.'' To be buried “ in the myddes of the
Church of the Grey Freres of London.'' His executors
were to “ ordeyne a stone to lye upon my grave with an
ymage of a yard longe closed in a shete kynt at both
endes of the same ymage.”
