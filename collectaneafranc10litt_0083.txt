History os the Grey Friars, London 7 1

who when at Royston on 20 May, 1394 (apparently
collecting some payments due to his house), was set on,
beaten, and robbed of 205. in money. The incident may
perhaps illustrate the unpopularity of the mendicant
friars at the close of the fourteenth century.

The second document 1 1s also a Petition 1n Chancery,

³ the date of which can be fixed to 14 3 3-6 Apart from

its immediate purpose, which was to recover money left
to the Convent by a penitent ex-friar, the document has
a little mterest as containing a reference to the occupation
of the Friars' Houses by the Queen, probably Joan of
Navarre.

The third document 2 is the Notarial Instrument
certifying the Agreement for Masses made with William
Cantelowe in 14 585³ In itself it is of little importance,
but it is of great interest as giving a complete list of the
Friars present in the London House on 27 March, 1460.
The total number is 34 3 this is a great falling off from the
fourteenth century, when the numbers ranged between
60 and 90. With the exception of the Deed of Surrender
it is the only instance of a complete list of the F riars that
we possess. It adds a number of new names, and in
several instances gives dates where previously we had
only the names. It shows also that John Kyrye was
Guardian as late as 1460, and adds William Goddard to
the list of known “ Custodes Londonie.''

The fourth document4 is a Petition in Chancery by
Eryk de Vedica, a physician and a Friar of the London
house, and James Walle, the Warden or Guardian. The
main interest of the document is for other than Francis-
can history. But for us it is of value as showing that a
Friar might practise medicine and take a fee, and as
fixing approximately the date at which Walle was
Guardian.

Before turning to the additions which can be made to
the list of Friars of the London House 5 I will deal with
certain corrections which can be made in the List of
