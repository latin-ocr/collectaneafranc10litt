the chapel on the north part of the choir furnishes a
sufficient explanation of the alternative name. In 1478
John Lethum‚ a baker, directed that he should be buried
before the Altar of S. Clement‚ which was apparently
in the same enclosure as S. Mary Altar; Nicholas Bray,
another baker, whose will was proved in 1449, also
refers to the Altar of S. Clement; both Lethum and
Bray made bequests to the Fraternity of S. Clement of
the Craft of Bakers3 Bray specifically associates the
Fraternity with Greyfriars—this appears to be the only
Fraternity in connection with the Grey Friars Church of
which we have record1 In the will of Anne Lucas 1n
1524 the Altar of S. Mary 1s described as the morrow-
mass altar 3 perhaps the mass of requiem was commonly
celebrated there. The screen between the Altars and the
Nave proper is several times referred to as the Valence‚2
and is probably intended by the “ bars '' in the will of
William Asshe in 1406.

In the Nave we are able to fix exactly the position of
the Pulpit, which, from the wills of Thomas Roos and
William Robynson in 1 52 9, appears to have been against
the first pillar of the Nave proper on the north side3 on
the south side of that pillar Mr. Shepherd’s plan of the
tombs shows a void space, where it is probable that the
Pulpit stood. It is no doubt this pillar that Alice Lucas
in 1524 described as standing within “ burdes and
pykes '’; she may have meant either the Pulpit itself or
a railing round it ; supposing that the Pulpit was only a
boarded platform with a rail round about the psslar, the
description would be reasonable enough.

The position of the Organ is given in the will of
Nicholas Pembyrton in 1519, who was to be buried on
the north side of the Choir in our Lady Chapel by the
Organs. We know that Pembyrton's tomb was towards
the west end of the Chapel of S. Mary.

In two wills we get two references to a window.
