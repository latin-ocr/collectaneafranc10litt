History os the Grey Friars, London 73

in the Register, which no doubt quotes the inscription.
If Shrewsbury is accepted as Guardian, Allen may have
succeeded him in 1487. William Goddard the younger,
who died in 1485, is described as “ gardianus loci '';
this may mean that he was Guardian at the time of his
death, in which case he succeeded Walle. On the other
hand, it is possible that Goddard succeeded Kyrye3 it
is to be noted that he is senior to Walle in the list of 1460.
Allen might then have held office for the whole term
between Walle or Shrewsbury and Bavard. Bavard's
name appears in the list of 1460, and also in the will of
George Belton in 1473 ς these references have, however,
no bearing on his office as Guardian. Bavard is described
in the Register as ‘⁴ gardianus loci,” which may possibly
mean that he held the office till his death.

From a reference to him in 1514 it had been supposed
that Standish was at that time Guardian, but from the
wills of John Talley and William Kebyll it is now clear
that Standish was Provincia] as early as 1 5 October, 1 509,
and Cutler Guardian of London as early as 9 August,
1509. Ι1 is, therefore, possible that Cutler succeeded
Bavard in or before Ι 508. There is now no evidence that
Standish was ever Guardian of London, though if Bavard

we know that Cutler was Guardian on '6 April and 1 2 June,
1 52 Ι . Η6 is known also to have been Guardian in 1 509,
1514, 1515, and 1518. In the will of Julyan Maryner,
which is dated 21 Oct„ 1516, Cutler is described as
‘⁴ late Wardayn of the Gray ffreers of London.” It seems
probable that he had two terms of office: the first from
1509 (or earlier) to 1515, and the second from 1518 10
1521 or 1524. Η6 survived till 1530, and is described
as “ quondam gardianus.'' Walter Goodfield, who died
on 27 Dec., 1521, is described in the Register as “ gar-
dianus loci '⁹ ; if this is to be interpreted as meaning that
he was Guardian at the time of his death he cannot have
held the office for more than a very few months. More
probably he was Guardian from 1515 10 1518. From
