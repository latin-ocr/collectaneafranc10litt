prayers of the Friars, like those of John Wydeslade in
1468 for 500 masses (5l. in all), of John Wardall in 1472,
whose bequest of Iol. apparently secured a perpetual
chantry, and of Richard Godfrey, who in 1 500 bequeathed
20 marks for an obit by note yearly during twenty years.
Of the actual funerals one of the most stately was that of
Sir John Devereux in 1393, with its provision for tapers
and torchbearers. In contrast to this was the direction
of Sir John Blount in 1485 that there was to be “ no
grete pompyous herse about my body.” The funeral
of Sir Stephen Jenyns in 1 52 3, for which 40 tapers were
to be provided, must have been a costly one. The ex-
penditure on torches and wax tapers was often consider-
able, but some or all of them were commonly left to be
burnt afterwards during mass as long as they lasted. It
was, however, on masses and religious services that money
was chiefly expended. The most elaborate, though not
the most costly, provision is perhaps that contained in the
will of William Kebyll in Ι 510. Other interesting wills
of this kind are those of John Fernandes in 1484, who was
to be buried in “ an abite of the most poorest frere,'' and
made provision for month-mind and twelve-month mind ;
of Elizabeth Uvedale in 1488, who left Iool. ⁴for a
perpetual mass and obit; of John Talley, who left Iol.
in 1509 for special services during three years after his
death ς and of Stephen Lynne in 1529, whose obit was
to be kept for eight years, Though different in character,
mention must be. made of the direction of John Att Woode
in 1489, that the costly mortuary cloth which he ordered
to be provided for his Fraternity at S. Sepulchre's should
be brought every year to the Grey Friars and laid on his
herse at his year's mind. Nor can reference be omitted
to the provision which James Wylford made in 1 527 for a
sermon to be preached annually by one of the Friars at the
Church of S. Bartholomew the Little on Good F riday.

It is noteworthy that there is no sign in the wills of
any decay in religious observance up to the very eve of
the Reformation. Indeed, the two latest wills, those
of Elizabeth Copley and Ann LegO, which were not
