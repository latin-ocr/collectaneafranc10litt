16 The Gospel Harmony of John de Caulibus

The translation ends with the descent of Christ to Hell,
and does not deal with the resurrection.

Cap. lxxxv. Meditatio domini Jesu, die Sabbata descendentis ad
infernum.1 . . . Cum ergo presenserunt eius saluberrimum ad-
ventum, occurrerunt ei gaudenter, seipsos exhortantes, atque
dicentes, Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel, qui visitauit, etc.

The next translation of the Meditationes on the Passion
(known from a colophon as the Privity qf the Passion)3
may, from its northern dialect and style of translation,
be a work of Richard Rolle, who died in 1349 3 it may,
however, be merely the work of some follower.4 It
begins at the usual place, but goes farther than the earlier
verse translation, taking in some of the resurrection
appearances.5 This rather beautiful prose translation
makes no attempt to follow the Latin closely.

Another distinct and rather more terse prose transla-
tion of the Passion, this time in the southern dialect, was
made before the end of the fourteenth century, and occurs

1 1609 ed„ vi, 392· 2 Meditacyuns, 36, 37.

3 Privity is the translation of the mysteria (passionis), a phrase occurring
at the beginning of the translated portion of the Meditationes in the
Thornton MS., in which the colophon occurs: see 1609 ed„ vi, 384.
Horstrnann printed the Privity from this MS. of c. 1430—1440 (see i,
198) ; but the Privity also occurs in Trin. Camb. 223, a MS. written
c. 1400, from which the passage here printed is given. In this earlier MS.
the piece begins at the traditional incipit of the passion, Adueniente iam
et imminente ς 1116 Thornton MS. omits the description of the Last Su pper,
and begins at the description of the passion proper.

4 The work is ascribed to Bonaventura in each MS., the translator's
name being omitted, as was usual in the fourteenth century. The work is
followed in Trin. Camb. 223 by many northern lyrics, usually accepted
as Rolle's.

5 Trin. Camb. 223 has the same explicit as the Thornton MS.; see
Horstmann, i, 218.
