VI. Friar Henry of Woclsto‘ne and the Jews. ,
By A. 0. Little. 1

HE Register of the Grey Friars of London

(p. 103) notes that Friar Henry of Wodylston

was buried ‘⁴ under a stone inscribed with letters
formerly legible '’ in the ambulatory between the Choir
and the Altars, and adds that by his efforts all the Jews
were finally expelled from England in the time of
Edward III.

This Friar Henry is mentioned in an anonymous
collection of exempla of the early fourteenth century
(MS. Sloane 2478, f. 15b). On 25 July‚ 1256, a priest
named Ralph, being in mortal sin, was celebrating mass
for the dead in the Church of S. Mary Magdalene in

the suburb of Oxford. As he elevated the Host and

raised his eyes he saw descending head downwards from
the height a man, who seized the Host in one hand and
dealt him a severe blow on the jaw with the other.
Ralph fainted‚ and, when he recovered, sent his confession
to a sick priest hard by, who absolved him and instructed
him to go to the bishop's penitentiary. “ The bishop's
enitentiary1 then was Friar Henry, of the Order of
Eriars Minor, called of VVodeston> and the said priest
(Ralph) was his scholar. The latter asked him to tell
this miracle to all faithful Christians out of reverence to
the body of Christ without specifying the sin.’' The
story is incorporated in several versions of the Speculum
Laicorum (MSS. Brit. Museum Add. 17723--where the
date is given as 1356—Harl. 6653 Bodl. Bodley 474, ·
University College, Oxford,⁴ 29), in the Historia Aurea
of John of Tinmouth (MS. Lambeth 12, f. 2o5b; cf.
Bodl. Laud Misc. MS. 389, f. 190, and MS. 524), andin
another anonymous collection (MS. Bodley 529, f. 1 72b). 2
Thomas of Walsingham‚ in his Gesta Abbatum, i, 400-
406, gives a detailed account of“ the process of acquisi-
tionH or restitution of the manor of Childewike'' by Roger,
