42 The List of Librarz‘es in tlze Catalogue of ¹}

This looks like a mere error of the scribe of R. Instead of l

writing Cirencester 104, Glamorgan 10 5, he has put ἶ
down Cirencester 1 05, and left out Glamorgan (Margam). q
The resultant confusion is slight. Ι do not know whether l
the text of R. has references both to 104 and 105.

Allowing for all omissions in numbering, the total sum ³
of libraries named in R. is 1 82, or 1 83 counting Burgus ἶ
S. Petri3 in T. 185, in B. 193. ζ

When we examine the list of names we find, Ι think,
that the worst mistakes occur in 3 D Ι, and that, on the ³
whole, T. is inferior to R. and B. in accuracy. There
are places in Β. in which one suspects Tanner's transcript

 

rather than his archetype of being in fault, e.g., 16 ⁴
Prioratus Roberti for Pons Roberti. It is plain, too, that ¹
Tanner has sometimes altered the mediaeval spelling to 3

that of his own time, in Barnabae, Mariae, etc. 3 but the
general faithfulness of his copy need not be doubted.

As to individual names. Taking the Custodies as they
occur, that of London contains but one entry that is at
all doubtful, 18 Novus locus, and I can have no doubt
myself that this is Newark on the Wey alias Aldbury in
Surre .

In ySarum, 31 S. Barnabae is an alternative name,
according to Tanner's Notitia, for Hyde Abbey or
Newminster. Any dedication to S. Barnabas (now
such a popular recipient) is a rarity in mediaeval times.
32 S. Marie Wynton, which would now mean Win-
chester College or New College, is here no doubt the
very much older Benedictine nunnery of Winchester
called Nunnaminster.

R. T. 36 Monasterium Heros (Tanner in the Bibl.
adds sive Hedems), B. 36 Herles, does suggest a doubt.
Might not Herles stand for Hurley (Berks.‚) a cell to
Westminster. Ρ Ι do not think so. Tanner (Notitia) gives
Monasterium Hederosum as the proper name of Ivy-
church, Wilts. Regarded as a rendering of the English
name it is a blunder‚ for Ivychurch means, in fact, the
Church of S. Iwig, an obscure Winchester saint. But,
geographically, Ivychurch and not Hurley is suitable
