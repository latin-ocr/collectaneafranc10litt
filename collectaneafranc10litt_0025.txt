The Gospel Harmony of John de Caulibus 13

S. Bonaventura in 1 274. The frequence of these English
translations should help to determine the rea] date of the
work, and show also that Arundel's commendation of
Love’ s translation 1n 1410 was no new departure. He
was merely commending a fresh translation of the work
which had for nearly a hundred years in England been
considered the best book for instructing devout lay people

in the events of the gospels.
The Latin manuscripts of the Meditationes in the larger

English collections are frequent,1 both in whole and part.
Of those known to the writer, twenty-two contain the
whole text or with only small ornissions,2 ten contain
the Passion only,from the institution of the Lord's supper?

1 No search has been made for those in private collections or cathedra]
libraries, nor has an exhaustive search been made in the collections con-
sulted. There is, of course, no critical edition of the Meditationes, as the
Quaracchi editors did not print it 3 and critical comparison of the English
MSS. (of the Latin Meditationes) alone would have little value for deter-
mining date or authorship.

2 These have usually the incipit of the prologue (1609 ed., vi, 334),
‘⁶ Inter alia virtutum et laudum praeconia '’ 3 or of the text (id., vi, 3 3 5),
“ Cum per longissima tempora.’' The explicit (id., vi, 401) is, with less
regularity‚ ‘⁶ Ergo iteratio utriusque decorem substantiae designauit. Haec
Bernardus,'' and doxology. The MSS„ roughly in chronological order,
are : fourteenth century, Univ. Coll. Oxford, 18 ς Rawl. e. 287 3
Bodl. 162 ; Rawl. A. 398 ; Harl. 4725 3 Harl. 1801 ς fifteenth century,
Royal 7 A. 13 7 D. xvii; Bodl. 529; Camb. Univ. Kk. 4, 23, Hh. 3, 13,
Ff. 5, 36, Ff. 3, 8 ; Harl. 31743 Laud Misc. 2573 Laud Misc. 4963
Caius 3323 Emmanuel 2413 St. John’s Camb. 83 3 Camb. Univ. Dd.
10, 15 ; C.C.C. Camb. 256 ; sixteenth century, Camb. Univ. Dd. 10, 63.
All the MSS. attribute the work to S. Bonaventura, and Rawl. A. 398,
Ff. 5, 36, and Dd. 10, 15 term it the “liber aureus de vita Christi per
dominum Bonaventuram compositus‚” instead of the more usual ‘⁶ Medi-
tationes vitae Christi Bonauenturae Cardinalis.'’ (Both titles are given in
Royal 7 A. 1, c. 1400.) None of the MSS.appears to be earlier than c. 13 50.

3 These all have the incipit, ‘⁴ Adueniente iam et imminente tempore ⁷’
(1609 ed., vi, 382), and go down to the meditation for Saturday, the
descent of Christ into Hell, where He is greeted by the O. Test. saints
singing the Benedictus ε the explicit <id.‚ vi, 392) is that of the end of the
Benedictus: ‘⁶ fecit redemptionem plebis suae.'' A MS. of this section
appears earlier than any of those of the whole Meditationes (Trin. Camb.
293), and the earliest English translation (see p. 14) was made before
13 50, and of exactly this section of the Meditationes. The MSS. include
