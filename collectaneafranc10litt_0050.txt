Newcastle) and a list of some 70 authors and their
works‚ not arranged in alphabetical order. The other, of
which two complete copies are known to me (British
Museum Royal 3 D Ι, and Peterhouse 169), contains
the list of libraries arranged under Custodiae as above,
and a list of over 80 authors in alphabetical order.
This is followed by a synopsis or digest of commentaries
upon the whole Bible‚ and the entire work is named
Tabulae Septem [not Octo] Custodiarum super Bibliam.
There are other MSS. of it, eg„ at Balliol College, which
contain only the commentary and not the lists of libraries
and authors. ’

The division of the country into Custodiae is an un-
mistakeable token of Franciscan origin, and Boston, as
was natural, obliterates it. The number of the Custodies,
however, is remarkable. That of Sarum, Professor Little
informs me, is not heard of (save in these lists) after about
12 50.1 It is further noteworthy that the Tabula, though
enumerating eight Custodies, calls itself Tabula Septem
Custodiarum.

This at once raises the question of the date of the
compilation of the list. Ι cannot answer it of my own
knowledge, · our MSS. tell us nothing : none of them is
older than the fifteenth century: Boston' s date 1s at the
very beginning of that century (1410).That1s the ter-
minus ad quem. The terminus a quo 1s the disappearance
of the Salisbury Custodia, i. e., 12 50 or thereabouts.

I have been accustomed to assume that the Registrum
Anglie is older than the Tabula, for two main reasons:
first, the non-alphabetical order of authors—an alpha-
betical order, if original, would surely never have been
disturbed by a later writer, · second, the fact that the
Tabula includes a few more writers than the Registrum‚
seemingly 20. (On the other hand, Registrum seems to
have seven which are not in Tabula.) The additions of
Tabula are chiefly in the class of ancient authors.

Until, therefore, other evidence is produced I will
