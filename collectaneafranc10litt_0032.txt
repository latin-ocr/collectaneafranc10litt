ΠΙ. Friar Alexander ancl his Historical Interpre-
tation of the Apocalypse. By J. P. Gilson.

MONG the Moore MSS. in Cambridge Uni-
Aversity Library (Mm. 5, 31) is an Exposition of
the historical sense of the Apocalypse of S.

John, composed in 1242 by a Friar Alexander, ‘vir
simplex et laicus,’' illustrated with more than seventy
interesting drawings. The MS„ the date of which can
hardly be many years later, has unfortunately lost a
number of leaves 1n various parts, and those that remain
are badly misbound. Both the hand and the drawings
seem to me English in character. Specimens will be
found in the New Palaeographical Society' 3 publications,
Series ΙΙ, pt. v, and it is not my purpose to deal with
them here. Nor am I concerned with the substance of
the interpretation itself‚ to me at least much less interest-
ing, except 1n so far as it throws light on the personality
of the author and his view of the times in which he lived.
The important passages for this purpose are mainly 1n
the commentary on chapters xx· -,xxu and as so little
is known of the author and his work it seems worth
while to call attention to these passages. So far as I am
aware, there are only two other MSS. of the Exposition‚
and one of these, which has been reproduced in fac-
simile, is a fourteenth-century abridgement, from which
the most interesting parts have been left out. It is
of French origin, and is in Prague Cathedral Library.
The reproducffion, lithographed in 1873, bears the title
Scriptum super Apocalypsim cum Imaginibus (Wenceslai
Doctoris). Wenceslas was doubtless merely a former

owner The other MS. is not accessible to me, being
in Breslau University Library (MS. I Q. Ι9,> and

my knowledge of it 1s confined to a reference in the
Quaracchi edition of S. Bonaventura’s works‚ vol vi,
introd. pp. ix, Χ.

Before proceeding to the study of the chapters in
question something must be said of the preliminary
matter of the book. The date appears from a quatrain
prefixed to the table of contents‚ as follows:
