bequests for repairs or the work of the church‚1 but the
only specific: ones are those of William Maryner in 1 512
of Iol. for the reparation and paving (the pavement is
known to have been repaired about this time), and of
Nicholas Newton in 1 5 37 of 105. for the reparation of the
Library, as in glazing. The will of Margaret Yonge in
1 501 contains a bequest of a garnish of pewter and other
articles to the Ostrye‚ which is perhaps the only specific
mention of the Guest-house that we have 3 she also
bequeathed a number of utensils to the kitchen. Amongst
the early burials there are a few which were to be outside
the church : William Conyngrove in 1410> Alice
Northfolke in 1412, and William Michell in 1446 were
to be buried in the cloister. Three burials were to be in
the cemetery‚ viz„ Richard Barton 1406, Walter Elys
1409, and Lawrence Gorlefen 1417; presumably these
were in the churehyard, but the similar direction by
Robert Houghton in 1493 apparently referred to the
Nave. Barton' 5 will is noteworthy‚ Since his buria] was
to be in the cemetery before the image of S Francis;
this we may, perhaps, feel assured refers to a statue 111
the churchyard outside the west door. John Bayle in
1446 was buried in the cemetery at the west end of the
church. Thomas Dolphyn in 1521 specifically directed
that he should be buried in the green churchyard; and
Alice Baynton in 1527, that she was to be buried in the
green cloister.

The mention of individua] Friars as spiritual advisers,
or as executors or witnesses of wills, or as ones whose
prayers are specially desired, furnishes us with a number
of new names. Five wills are also of importance for the
information they contain as to the succession of Guardians.
But these matters will be better dealt with later on.

In addition to the extracts from wills, four other
documents bearing on the history of Greyfriars‚ London,
are here printed. The first 2 is a Petition in Chancery
seeking redress for a robbery from Friar Geoffrey Torre,
