Friar Henry of W odstone and tlze Jews 1 55

while the endorsement is in the elegant hand of a pro-
fessional scribe. Though the only date given is the eve
of Holy Cross day (Ι 3 September), the reference to the
Chapter at Cambridge and the election of a minister leave
no doubt that the year is 1 28 5. It is known that William
of Gainsborough became minister in this year, and we
now have evidence that he was elected in the Provincia]
Chapter at Cambridge. The letter is interesting as another
original document emanating from a Provincial Chapter——
the third printed in this volume.1 It is addressed to John
of Kirkby, the treasurer, and conveys the thanks of the
Chapter for a gift of loos. for one day’s expenses, which
had been handed to the proctors of the Friars Minor.
John of Kirkby is here described as Archdeacon of
Stafford-—an unusual, if not unique, designation (the
usual one is Archdeacon of Coventry), though he was
already Bishop-elect of Ely‚ and was ordained priest and
consecrated Bishop by Peckham about a week later.

It is not clear what Wodstone’s position in the
Chapter was. Though undertaking some of the functions
of the newly-elected provincial before the latter entered
on his duffies, he does not appear to have been vicar.
William of Gainsborough himself was addressed by
Bishop Giffard of Worcester as “ V icar of the Order of
Minors,'' on 1 August, 128 5.2 “ Frater Alanus fratrum
minorum Anglieane provincie vicarius ’' wrote to the
King about the arrest of an apostate on 8 September,
128 5 : this was probably the day on which the Chapter
met at Cambridge, but the vicar's letter is dated at
Winchester.3 Again, on 9 September, 1285, the Prior
of Christ Church, Canterbury, addressed a letter
