Robert White and his wife were buried in the second bay of the
Nave immediately west of the Altars (Grey Friars, p. 1 1 7). Their
tomb was, therefore, close to Our Lady of Pity, as to which see
p. 67 above. The Will shows that Cutler was Guardian as late
as June 1521. If, therefore, Goodfield succeeded him, he can only
have held office for a very short time. Alternatively Cutler may
have had two terms. · the one from 1508 to 1515, and the other
from 1518 onwards. Goodfield might then have been Guardian
from 1515 to 1518.
