'Interpretation of the Apocalypse 3 5·

as to the man himself. He was a Saxon, vir simplex e

laicus, probably connected with the diocese of Bremen

*and acquainted with Friar Albert of Stade and either
directly or through Friar Albert with the schoolmaster
of Bremen, whose name was Henry 3 and from the tags
of verse which he quotes we may possibly suspect that
Alexander himself had something to do with the education
of youth. On consulting Hodenberg's Die Dib‘cese
Bremen· (1859, iii, p. 28) we find that Henry's date is

lArchbishop of Armagh and resigned that see in 1247.
l Albert's successor as scholasticus was Alexander (of
{Bekeshovedq I suppose the modern Buxtehude), whose
³ name occurs in 1237 and 1238, but not after 1241. If
we suppose that this Alexander left his schoolmastering
to become a friar it is not impossible that he may be the
author of our exposition. The hypothesis might even
serve to explain the conveyance of the treatise to England,
if we suppose that Alexander transmitted a copy to his
predecessor in his Irish diocese and that somebody copied
it again on the way thither 3 and, as we have seen, there
are some slight indications that matters Irish were ex-
pected to be of interest to the reader of the exposition.
That Albert Suerbeer himself was not a friar (Gams calls
him a Franciscan, Eubel a Dominican) may be inferred
from the entry about him in the Annales Stadenses (p. 360),
but he was closely associated with the friars in Ireland.1
whether, however, the identification of our author with.
the Bremen schoolmaster be accepted or not, we shall
probably be safe in regarding him as the same person as
Fabricius's Frater Alexander Alemannicus (Saxo), who

Alexander of Bekeshovede (Buxtehude ?) and England might be Friar
Adam, chief physician among the early F ranciscans in England: he is
called Adam de Bechesoueres, Hekeshovre, Bethgore, etc.—(Little‚ Grey
F riars in Oxford, p. 187 ; Cat. of Romanas, Brit. Mus„ iii, 634)—
evidently a foreign name which puzzled his English confreres‚ and may well
be identified with Bekeshovede. But the intercourse between the English
and Saxon Franciscan provinces was at this time very close. (A. G. L.)
