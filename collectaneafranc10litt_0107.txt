edited by d'Arcy Power in E.E.T.S. Tederyk is Teodorico dei
Borgognoni, 1206—1298‚ surgeon at Bologna‚ works printed first
at Venice 1498. Parvum Lamfrank is the Chirurgia Minor of
Lanfranchi de Milano, written 1270. Anothonomye is probably
the Anatomy of Nicholas of Salerno, published by F. Redeker
(Leipzig, 191 7),which became popular in early thirteenth century,
and is sometimes printed among the spurious works of Galen t
it proceeds from head to heel, an unusual method for anatomies.
