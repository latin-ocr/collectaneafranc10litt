Friar Henry of W adstone and tlze Jews Ι 5 3

The Council was attended by Richard, King of the
Romans, the Archbishop of York, and the Bishops of
Worcester and Lichfield and others. The date of the
Council is unknown. There was some delay in publishing
the new laW, owing, it was surmised, to the efforts of the
Jews and their supporters. In consequence of this the
brothers Giffard, Archbishop of York and Bishop of
Worcester, wrote a strongly-worded letter, dated 7 July,
1271, to Master Richard of Stanes, justiciar, urging him
to secure the co-operation of the Chancellor,1 the justices
of the Bench, and the “ majores Curiae,'' who were more
favourably disposed, and to use other means, to get the
statute as speedily as possible fully enrolled and published3
they warn him that, though some may try to weaken the
new statute, the prelates will have no nonsense.2

The Giffards, both of whom were closely connected with
the Friars Minor, seem to have been moved to take this
action by Henry of Wodstone, for they incorporated in
their letter the following document, which is preserved
in MS, Bodley 91, a thirteenth-century MS„ containing
(inter alia) a number of documents relating to the Barons’

War.
(MS. Bodl. 91, fo. 140.)

Contra Judeos per quendam fratrem minorum.

Cum iudei fidei christiane aduersantes‚ ex sola gracia principum
hactenus in regno moram facientes, nitantur ad communes fidelium
regni Anglie libertates optinendas de libero tenemento in regno
Anglie possidere, et libero tenemento pertinentibus; quod si
optinere potuissent, racione liberorum tenementorum fideles in
liberis tenementis ipsis infidelibus corporale sacramentum de fideli-

ecclesias eciam ad tenementa que iudei haberent pertinentes pre-

2 Printed in Walsingham, Gesta Abbatum, i, p. 402, and Liber de
antiquis legibus, p. 2 34. The letter does not appear in the registers of either
of the prelateS. The glimpse which the story gives into the actual working
of the legislative machine is not without interest to the constitutional

historiari.
