Her grave was in the second bay of the Nave, next that of Gilbert
Belamy 3 but the name is an addition, and it is possible that the
exact position is not accurately given. But the reference is evidently
to Our Lady of Pity, the position of which thus seems to be clearly
fixed at the right hand of the entry to the Altar of S. Mary, to
which presumably the ‘⁶ morow messe aulter '⁹ refers. The
“pellor within burdes and pykes '⁹ should then be the first column
west of the Altars„ where was the pulpit 3 the “ burdes and pykes ''
may refer to a railing round the pulpit, or be a description of the
pulpit itself. Grey Friars, p. 1 1 7.
