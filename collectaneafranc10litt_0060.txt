library references than R. and T„ begins with 82 Bury,

the list of S. Augustine's works.

Here T. makes two additions to R. B. gives a much
shorter list, of which all the items but one (97) are
common to the others.

Here follows the best attempt I can make at an ex-
planatory comparative text of the list of libraries. Be it
noted, by way of addition to the other signs explained in
the note at the head of the list, that the sign ‚‚ ‚‚ when
found in the second or third column, means identity
with the preceding column : when found in the last column
it means identity with the entry above it.
