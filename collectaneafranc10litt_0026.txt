14 The Gospel Harmony of John de Caulibus

and three are fragments.1 The section on the Passion
seems to have been almost regarded as a separate
work, and 1s found thus separate in the earliest manu-
scripts, particularly in one dated by Dr. M. R. James as
early fourteenth century. 2 This section was certainly the
first to be translated, and, till Nicholas Love’ s translation,
was found translated more frequently than either the
whole or any other part of the Meditationes.

The first English translation is in verse, and was for
some time attributed to Robert of Bourne, the translator
of the Handlying Synne. Dialectal reasons are, however,
against a common authorship, as is the fact that the
sources of Robert's other translations were in Anglo-
French (the Manuel des Pechiez and the Chronicle of
Langtoft), while the Meditationes were, of course, in
Latin. But the poem follows the Handlying Synne in each
of the two complete and primary manuscripts, and from
its language may be assigned to the same date—between
1300 and 1330.3 Works of popular instruction were,
about 1300, nearly always written in verse, as aids to
memorization, and, like the contemporary and popular
“ romances‚'' were much more widely known through
this means than through actual use of the manuscripts.

Bonaventura de passione domini nostri Ihesu Christi. Adueniente iam et
imminente . . . ” f. 17 : “ Expl. medit. quas scripsit Card. Bonaventura
de passione J. C.’' It is followed by the Stimulus Amoris, a work often as-
cribed to S. Bonaventura‚ but written by a F ranciscan JacobuS, lector at
Milan, towards the end of the thirteenth century, and revised, perhaps,
by Henri de Beaume in the fourteenth century. The version in this MS.
appears to have more affinities to the revised than to the original version,
and may represent an intermediate state.

³ The three MSS. (see p. 1 ς, n. 2) attribute the original to Bonaventura.
