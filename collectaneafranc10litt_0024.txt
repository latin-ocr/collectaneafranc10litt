12 The Gospel Harmony of John de Caulibus

harmony was published for popular reading—that of the
Franciscan bishop, Francis Ximenes.1

The authorship of these widely-read Meditationes is of
interest. The Vatican 1609 edition of S. Bonaventura' s
works printed it as S Bonaventura’ s, in2 accordance with
the ascription in many manuscripts32 the Quaracchi
editors of 1908 condemned it as spurious. They attri-
buted it with some reserve to friar John de Caulibus‚3 of
whom Bartholomew of Pisa wrote in his work De Con-
sormitate vitae beati Francisci ad vitam Domini Jesu
Redemptoris nostri ε

Tractatum meditationis super evangelia fecit frater Joannes
de Caulibus de sancto Geminiano . . . Custodia Senensis habet

. . locum de Sancto Geminiano de quo exstitit oriundus frater
Joannes de Caulibus‚ magnus praedicator et devotus, qui medita-
tiones super Evangelia fecit pulchras, . . ‚4

The difficulty connected with this attribution is the
lateness of the date to which Wadding assigns John de
Caulibus of S. Gemignano, and in which he has been
followed by modern reference books. Wadding, using
Bartholomew of Pisa presumably as his only source, says
of John de Caulibus in the year 1376‚5

Frater johannes de Caulibus de sancto Geminiano eiusdem
provinciae (Tuscany), et custodiae (siena), qui pias meditationes
super quatuor evangelia composuit.

Either this date is guesswork or else John dc Caulibus
did not write these particular Meddaffiones, for they were
translated in England long before that date into both
verse and prose : nearer, in fact, to the date of the death of

5 Elsewhere he confuses Bartholomew's information‚ saying that de
Caulibus was a professor of theology of Milan (Scriptores, 136) ; for this
confusion see Sbaralea (Supplementum‚ 1 806, 40 5). Wadding's date, 1376,
is given to de Caulibus in Chevalier’s Bia-Biograpbie and other reference
books 3 it may be merely Wadding's inference from the date 1385, when
Bartholomevv of Pisa wrote his work,
