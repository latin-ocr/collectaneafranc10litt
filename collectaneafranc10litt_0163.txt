twenty-fourth Abbot of St. Albans, 1 260-1290. Sir
Geoffrey of Childewick‚ knight‚ held the manor of
Childwick, in Hertfordshire, of St. Albans, and inflicted

so poor that he borrowed from a Jew more than he could

St. Albans of a messuage and a carucate of land in

1 His father was also named Geoffrey‚ and the two are not clearly
distinguished. Geoffrey I is mentioned as justice of assize of mort d’ances-
tor for Hertfordshire in 1 228 (Pat. 12 Hen. ΙΙΙ, 111. 4d, Cal. P. R, p. 216,
217); he had dealings with the Jews (01056, 26 Hen.III‚ pt. 3, m. 1, 28
Hen. ΙΙΙ, 111. 2), and disputes with the Abbey of St. Albans about hunting
rights in 1 240 (Mat. Paris, Chron. Mas„ iv, 50-54). He seems to have died
in 1 244 01· 1 245, as in August 1 245 1116 king pardoned Geoffrey de Child-
wic 205„ which Geoffrey de Childwik‚ his father, had been fined in the
eyre ofjustices in Hertfordshire (Close, 29 Hen. ΙΙΙ, 111. 4). Geoffrey ΙΙ 15
51111 called ‘⁴ Galfridus de Childewik junior '' when attached for an
offence against the forest laws in 1246—1247 (Abbreviatio placitorum,
p. 105, 31 Hen. ΙΙΙ). He was also named Rufus (Cbron. Maj„ v, 129).
Some time before 1250 116 married Clarice‚ sister of John Mansel (Cal.
Pat. R. 1250, p. 803 Mat. Paris, Cbron. Mas„ v, 129); his wife was
‘⁴ adhuc sterilis ’' when Matthew Paris wrote. In 1 2 50-1 253 116 renewed
the quarrel with St. Albam, and was successful owing, it was said, to the
support of his brother-in-law (Chr-on. Mas„ v, 129, 2343 vi, 233, 252 3
Hist. Anglomm, iii, 62 ς Ρ31. 37 Η611. ΙΙΙ, 111. 18d). He served in Gas-
cony in 1253 (Cal. Pat. R. ad an., p. 231), and in France in 1259 (ibid,
p. 55), and was one of the four knights appointed to inquire into griev-
ances for Hertfordshire (not Herefordshire, as in Cal.) in 1258 (ibid,
p. 648). He appears to have supported the king in the Barons’ War
(Cal. Inq. Misc.‚ i, No. 302 ς cf. Cal. Pat. R. 1264, pp. 324, 329, 330,
333). Besides Childwick and Redburn in Herts., Geoffrey held lands in
Derbyshire (Charter R, 33 Hen. ΙΙΙ, 111. 3).
