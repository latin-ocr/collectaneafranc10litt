a feature in some wills. The earliest is that of Thomas
Cornton in 1410, who directed a marble stone with
scripture to be put on his tomb at a cost of not more than
265. 8d. The same amount was paid by Stephen Kelk
in 1501 for a marble stone. John Wardall in 1472, and
Robert Orchard in 147 3, both left directions for memorial
tablets to be put on the wall near their tombs. Thomas
Butside in 1497 directed a plate with scripture to be
put on the wall or a pillar. Thomas Dagworthe in 1474
had a stone with images of himself, his two wives, and
seventeen children. Thomas Grayson in 1502 ordered a
stone graven with an image a yard long, closed in a sheet
knit at both ends. Instances of brasses are those of John
Robynson in 1511 and George Barett in 1525. Sir
Thomas Lucy’s monument in 1527 also had pictures of
himself, his wife and children, and was probably a brass.
John Tresawell in 1 520 gave directions for a graven stone.
More elaborate tombs were those of Thomas Gloucester
in 1447, John Talley in 1509, who directed 10l. to be
spent, and William Kebyll in 1510. The directions in
Kebyll’s will show that provision for a tomb was some-
times made beforehand‚ and this also appears from the
wills of William Maryner in 1512, Richard, Lord
Willoughby‚ in 1513, and Sir Stephen Jenyns in 1523.
Incidentally the wills throw a good deal of light on the
fittings and ornaments of the Friars Church. Our know-
ledge of the actual plan was so complete that we should
not expect to add anything material. John Bailley in
1420 refers to Hatton Auter, which was apparently at
the west end of S. Francis Chapel, and had perhaps been
endowed through Friar Thomas Hatton.1 The All-
hallows Chapel 1s called the Vestry Chap el in the will of
Richard‚ Lord Willoughby, in 1513, and the Chapel of
8. Mary is described by Roger Spencer' in 1492 as the
Chapel of S. Barnardyne ; there may have been a second
altar in this chapel, as in that of 8. Francis, but perhaps
the direction given by Thomas Battell in 1468 that he
should be buried before the image of S. Bernardine in
