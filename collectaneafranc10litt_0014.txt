2 Documents at Canterbury Relating to the Grey Friars

Et si contingat prefatos procuratores post viginti dies postquam
super hoc premuniti fuerint in solucione predicti annui redditus
deficere, bene licebit predictis Priori et Conuentui et eorum minis-
tris distringere omnia tenementa predicta pro arreragiis que a retro
fuerint de annuo redditu supradicto. In cuius rei testimonium
sigillum ecclesie Christi predicte et sigillum commune fratrum
predictorum huic scripto cyrographato alternatim sunt appensa.
Acta sunt hec apud Cantuariam die et anno supradictis.

The seal attached to this deed is a very beautiful im-
pression and in wonderful condition, especially consider-
ing that it was affixed six-and-a-quarter centuries ago.
It ls of brown wax, an elongated oval 1n shape, 19s1⁸ 6 long
by 1'' in breadth. It bears a representation of the martyr-
dom of S. Thomas Becket in the centre: the saint 1s
kneeling before a vested altar, with the hands upraised‚
and is facing three of the knights (Hugh de Moreville is
absent), who with shields and raised swords are beating
down the Archbishop. There is a figure of Edward Grim,
the Saxon monk, with the cross uplifted standing on the
far side of the altar, but, as a matter of fact, the Arch-
bishop's crossbearer was Alexander Llewellyn, a Welsh-
man, who had left him two days before on a mission to
France 3 and the acting-crossbearer on the occasion of the
murder was Henry of Auxerre, one of Becket's clerks:
he doubtless fled with the rest of the monks from the
scene, leaving the three mentioned by Dean Stanley—
Robert, Canon of Merton, William Fitzstephen, his
chaplain, and Edward Grim. This last-named, in many
mediaeval representations of the murder, is depicted
holding the cross, as in the present instance}

The apex of the seal is filled with tabernacle work,
and at the bottom, under a pointed arch, is seen the
tonsured head of a friar (S. Francis ?) with his friar's
hood falling over his shoulders. Around is this legend:

S: FRATRVM ι MINORVM : CANTVARIE

1 The position of the cross in this seal suggests that the artist may have
reconciled the tradition preserved in the Thomas Saga (i, 541) that
Grim “ bore the cross '’ with the statement in a contemporary letter that
Thomas had the cross in his hands when done to death (Materials, vii, 43 1).
