John Boston and tlze Kindred Documents 4 5

which have yet to be identified),1 the library references
are more regularly supplied, but in cases where R. and T.
give a great many B. diminishes the number of thern.
More noticeable than this, from our point of view, is the
fact that in R. and T. (and particularly in R.) a very large
number of the libraries in this list are not referred to at
all : 72 seem to be omitted by R., 59 or 60 by T., and
about 34 by B. The largest number of omissions in
R. and T. are in the Custodies of Oxford, Cambridge,
Worcester‚ and York. B. supplies more gaps in the
Cambridge custody than in any other.
The figures are> for the several Custodies :

London R. omits 6, B. supplies 5

Sarum R. 4, B. 2
Oxon. R. 1 6, B. 7
Cambridge R. 1 9, Β. 1 2
Bristol R. 5, B. 2
Worcester R. 5, B. 1
York R. 1 4, B. 3
Newcastle R. 3, B. 2

Of the nine names added by Boston (168-175, 195) he
has references to six.

It is difficule to arrive at certainty as to which houses
are wholly omitted by all the authorities. The scope for
error in writing the numbers is so large that where one
finds but a single reference to a house the suspicion is
justified that it is a mistake. However, a tentative list
of the libraries which are either seldom or never men-
tioned will not be uninstructive.

2 S. Augustine’s, Canterbury, though not wholly omitted, oc-
curs far more seldom than one would have anticipated‚ in view
of its importance and of the many references to Christ Church.

4 Faversham—-occurs twice.

6 Boxley—twice.

1 One such source was a biographical list of Dominican writers, which
may be known to some reader of this article, but is not known to me.
It was also employed by Philip Wolf, of Seligenstadt, as I have ascertained
from a study of his list of Dominican writers printed by R. L. Poole 1n
English Historical Review, 1910, p. 513.
