1. EXTRAcTs FRoM WILLs RELATING To GREY
FRIARS, LoNDON.

THE great majority of these Wills come from those registered in
the Prerogative Court of Canterbury (P.C.C.). These Wills are
noted simply by the name of the volume with the number of the
quaternion in which the Will is to be found. The next in order are
the Wills proved in the Court of the Commissary of London 3 these
Wills are noted Comm. Lond„ with the name of the volume and
the number of the folio. Between 1 39 5 and 1414 some Wills are
given from the Register of the Archdeacon of London 3 noted
Archd. Lond., Reg. Ι, with the number of the folio. There are very
few Wills from other sources. Amongst the numerous Wills
registered in the Court of Husting which contain references to the
Grey Friars (chiefly bequests for masses) there are only six in-
stances where the testator desired to be buried at Greyfriars. It
has not appeared necessary to include these here, but it may be
useful to give the names and dates. 1286 John de St. Meynak 3
1389 John Philpot3 1425 John Basset3 1436 Guy Terry3
1439 John Barre alias Markeley3 1466 William Burton. Of
these Philpot‚ Basset, and Barre (or Barowe) appear in the Register‚
and Wills of Basset and Barre are given below.

Biographical notes which appear in the Grey Friars of London

are not repeated here.
