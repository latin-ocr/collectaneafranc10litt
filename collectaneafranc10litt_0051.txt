John Boston and the Kindred Documents 39

take it that the order of the authorities is Registrum‚
Tabula, Boston‚ and I will designate each by its initial
letter.

The annexed transcript of the list of libraries is
based upon the following authorities, some of which have
been already named: R. 1s from MS. Tanner 165 Τ.
from Royal 3D1 and Peterhouse 1693 Β. 1s from Tanner' s
transcript of the lost mediaeval MS. of Boston‚ which
transcript, once at Leeds Castle‚ Kent‚ was long 1n the
Phillipps collection at Chestenham, and was purchased
by the Cambridge University Library at the Phillipps
sale of 1890 (lot 500)

It 1s a curious list, alike 1n respect of nomenclature‚
omissions‚ and inclusions, and there are irregularities in
the numbering and other points to which attention will
be called.

First, as to its extent and order. R. and Τ. give a list
of 167 names numbered in Arabic figures, and intercalate
at three points 19 others numbered in Roman figures
(in this peculiar order: xiii-xxvii, v, vi, xi, xii). The
reason why Roman figures were employed at all may be
uncertainly guessed. The great block of them, xiii-
xxvii, v, vi, relate to the counties of Gloucester‚ Wilts.‚
Dorset, Somerset, Hereford‚ Monmouth‚ Brecon 3 xi and
xii to Cheshire and Shropshire. If the census oflibraries
was taken either by itinerant envoys or by local syndicates
we can understand that one such envoy or syndicate may
have employed a different system of numbering from the
rest, and that his or their work coming in later was
incorporated without alteration into the general catalogue
to save trouble. The choice of the numbers employed
can be explained in part: i, ii, iii, iiii would be liable
to confusion with Arabic figures3 it is not easy to see
why vii-x were not used.

It is to be feared, Ι may add, that the compilers or the
copyists sometimes translated Roman figures into Arabic
and vice versa. We certainly find the number x in the
text very often, and it has no place in the list. Boston‚
