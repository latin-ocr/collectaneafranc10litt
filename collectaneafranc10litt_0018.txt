6 Documents at Canterbury Relating to the Grey Friars

uncertain. The second letter is less formal : it relates to
the same subject, and though not dated is evidently later.
The third letter was addressed by Archbishop Win-
chelsea to the Prior and Convent on 20 October, 129 5.
The Archbishop exempts Brother Martin of Clive1 from
certain conventual duties on account of his weakness and
old age, in consideration of his prolonged labours, first
as regent master in arts and ever since then as student of
theology at Christ Church. It suggests that Friar
Ralph's pupils were not confined to the younger monks.
The fourth letter, from Archbishop Walter Reynolds,
is dated 27 April, 1321—nearly seven years after the
F ranciscans had ceased to supply lecturers to Christ
Church. In it the Archbishop states that he has found
in a recent visitation that the monks have provided no
suitable study for their reader, who has hitherto studied
in the Infirmary Han, and orders that one of the eighteen
studies (diversoria)‚2 lately made in a place suitable for
students‚ be assigned to the reader‚ and the Infirmary Hall
be freed from “strepitu populari.’' It is evident that the
Franciscan lecturers had had no proper study in the
monastery; but they may have resided at the Grey Friars‚
though this seems unlikely in view of letter (ii.) below.
