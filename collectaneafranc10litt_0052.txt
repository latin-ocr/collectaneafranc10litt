40 The List of Libraries in the Cdtalogue of

176-194 in his list, seems to make no reference to any
of them in his text, and as most of them are referred to in

R. T. suspicion is intensified. Add to this that xvii ἦ
is the one Roman number not to be found in R. T. and ἶ

that Boston also has no 17.

Boston, who has the whole list before him, discards, I re-
peat, this anomaly. He is not hampered by the division
into Custodiae of R. and T., and so he collects the Roman
figures together, puts them into their proper order, and
annexes them to the end of his list, where they stand as
176 (= v)-194 (= xxvii). His whole list runs to 195
items‚ which are made up thus : 1-1 67=I-I 67 of R. T. 3
168-175, eight names from his own neighbourhood in
East Anglia, added by himself3 176-194, the Roman-
figure names of R. T. ς 1 95, another addition of his own.

Now as to irregularities in the numbering. The first
is shown by the following extract :

Nouus locus 18 N. L. 18 N. L. 18

S. Pauli, London 19 S. Pauli, London 22 London, S. Pauli 19
Custodia Sarum Sarum

Waverle 19 Waverlee 19 Waverleye 20
Lewys 20 Lewes 20 Lewes 21

Cicestre 22 Chicestre 21 Cicestria 22
Sowyk 23 Suthwyk 23 Suthwych 23

R. has duplicated the number 1 9, and to correct the error
has omitted 2 1. Τ. has taken another way of correcting
and assigned the number 22 to St. Paul’s. B. has pre-
ferred to number straight on.

The result is that No. 19 means in R. either St. Paul's
or Waverley, in T. VVaverley only, in B. St. Paul's only.
No. 20 in R. and T. means Lewes, in B. Waverley.
No. 21 in R. means nothing, in T. Chichester, in Β.
Lewes. No. 22 in R. and B. means Chichester, in T.
St. Paul's. My own view is that the mistake originated
with R., which accidentally repeated the number 19 at
the beginning of the new section (Custodia Sarum). The
circular, or the travelling brother, or whatever machinery
