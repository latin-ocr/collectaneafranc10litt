IV. ‘The List of Libraries Prefixecl to the Catalogue
of John Boston and the Kindred DocumentS.
By M. R. JameS.

HE bibliographical census of English libraries

Ι known by the name of the Catalogue of John
Boston 1s at present only accessible 1n a printed
form 1n the extracts, referring to English authors, pre-
fixed to Tanner' s Bibliotheca Britannica, where the Preface
to the work is also given. We may hope that the whole
will be made available not very long hence, for there is a
prospect of its being included in a series of mediaeval
texts published at Louvain, and the work of editing has
been undertaken by the Benedictine Nuns of Stanbrook
Abbey, who have already spent some years upon the

study of the text.

The general lines of Boston’s work are well known 3
it need only be said here that the body of it consists of an
alphabetical list of nearly 700 authors, with a short
biographical notice of each, followed by a list of works
of which the title and first and last words are given;
and then we find a series of numbers which refer back to
a numbered list of monasteries, cathedrals, etc., subjoined
to the Preface. So that the numbers indicate in what
libraries copies of each work named could be found.

It is this list of libraries which forms the subject of the
present article.

But what, it may be asked, makes the work of John
Boston, a Benedictine monk of Bury, an appropriate
subject for Collectanea Franczscana. Ρ

The answer is that Boston' s Catalogue owes its incep-
tion, in all likelihood, to the Franciscan Order—for there
are two earlier forms of it. The one, preserved in a
single MS. (Bodl. Tanner 165), is entitled Registrum
Anglie de libris doctorum et auctorum veterum :1 it contains
the list of libraries, divided into eight Custodiae (London,
Sarum, Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Worcester, York,

1 There is a copy of part of it in one of Wharton’s volumes of collections
