In York 131 Hospitale Lincoln is doubtful. There 3

were three: S. Sepulchre, described as Gilbertine, S.

Mary Magdalene, and S. Giles; none of these seems to 3
be important. '3
136 Lusa, Luya (Louth Park). Does the y represent
a l> ? ἒ
138 Gorynton, Gromton (ἓ), Thornton, Toringtone 3

monachorum.

Though the matter is not strictly relevant to this
article, I will take occasion to say that all three works,
T., R., and R., are in a very incomplete state. In R. and T.

a great many of the works named have no library reference
attached to them. In B., where the number of authors'
names is enormously increased (by the aid of sources
