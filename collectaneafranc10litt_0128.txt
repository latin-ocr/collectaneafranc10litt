Possibly the widow of John Arnold, who had the Image of Our
Lady of Pity made. Her executor was William Breggys, who was

buried in the Nave in 1517. Grey Friars, pp. 1 16-19.

1494. RALPH HUDsoN. “ To be buried in the gray
ffreres before our Lady of Pyte.'’

There are two Wills‚ dated 27 June, without year z the
one, 3 Holgrave‚ proved 13 January, 149 3-4 3 the other,
3 1 Blamyr‚ proved 9 Oct„ 1 503. In the latter Will
administration was granted to John Cleton, who was
buried in the same place in 1 505.

Hudson’s tomb was at the south of the second bay in the North
Aisle of the Nave. Gilbert Belamy (p. 1 18 below), who was to be
buried before Our Lady of Pity, lay at the south of the door into
the Chapel of S. Mary's Altar. This confirms the statement in the
Will of Alice Lucas 1524 : that the Image was in the corner on
the right hand of that door (see p. 67 above).

In the Register the date of death is given as 27 June, 15303
this is probably an error for 1503, which may be the date of his
wife’s death. Grey Friars, pp. 1 18-19.
