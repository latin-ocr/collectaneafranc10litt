22 Friar Alexander and lzis Historical

Another interesting passage throws light on the
historica] material on which his mind was working
(f. 7ἐ>ει ‘Historie 1n quibus hec primitus didicimus in
ydioma teuthonicum erant translate3 sed modo latinis
sunt verbis conscripte. '' This presumably refers to the
Saxon Chronicle, the earliest prose chronicle written in
German, the first version of which was completed about
1237.l It will appear in the sequel that Alexander made
use of some of the Latin Chronicles on which the Saxon
Chronicle was based.

Passing over, then, the exposition of the first nineteen
chapters, in which Alexander traces the history of the 1
Christian church for the first eleven centuries, we find ξ
at the beginning of ch. xx that the binding of the Serpent Ἰ
by the Ange] (verses 1- -3) is interpreted as referring to
the excommunication by Pope Calixtus II of the Emperor
Henry V (the thousand years, it is to be noted, non
possunt facile accipi simpliciter' ') and the loosening for

a little season to the absolution accorded to him four
years before his death. The thrones in verse 4 are those
of the Holy See under Innocent II and of the Empire
under Lothaire. The Beast of the same verse is Saladin.
The passage which follows 1n the Cambridge MS. (f. Ι 84),
but 1s omitted 1n the Prague text, may be worth quoting
in full for the historical information as to early North
German bishoprics, as well as for the light lt throws upon
the authorship.

Siquidem cepit accendi noua lux in finibus cunctis imperii,
uidelicet tranquillitas temporum et habundanti[a] rerum. Thuri-
bulum quoque fidei deferri cepit per regionem Sclauie, Vicelino
sacerdote cum aliis Christi fidelibus quos aduocare poterat hoc
officium peragente. Hic erat natus de Quernhamele3 uir utique
