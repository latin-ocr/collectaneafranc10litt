34 Friar Alexander and his Historical

of Saxony. Two of the passages quoted from “ historia ''
are found in Celano's first Life of S. Francis. But most
of the quotations are from some work or works not
identified in which probably the passages from Celano had
been incorporated. The unknown “historia’' treated
(to judge from the allusions here made) of S. Dominic
and S. Francis and the early years of the two Orders ; it
also contained allegorica] interpretations of the precious
stones of the Apocalypse.

‘⁴ A guess may be hazarded that the ‘ historia ' was the
chronicle of Albert of Stade. Master Albert was ordained
Abbot of S. Mary’s Stade in 1232, and, after vainly
endeavouring for some years to convert his monastery
into a Cistercian Abbey, he joined the Franciscans of
Stade in 1240. In the same year he was writing his
chronicle, which survives in a mutilated form1 in the
Annales Stadenses. One would have expected Albert to
have given considerable space both to the Cistercian and ¹
to the F ranciscan movements ; the references to both are,
however, few and slight in the Annales Stadenses. It is
not unlikely that Alexander, who deals at some length
with both these Orders, may have incorporated in his
work lost parts of Albert’s original chronicle. It is,
however, doubtful whether Alexander ascribes to ‘ his-
toria ' any passage which occurs in the extant Annales
Stadenses. The relations between the two writers were
close and probably personal. Not only does Alexander
frequently make use of Albert's work, but Albert, in a l
continuation of his chronicle, quotes Friar Alexander’s l
‘ expositio apocalypsis.' ” 2 (A. G. L.) It may be noted l
that Stade was (at any rate later) one of the houses included 1
in the Franciscan custody of Bremen. ¹

Let us now sum up what we have been able to gather

2 Ann. Stad„ p. 372, ad an. 1250. ‘⁴ Hiis auditis rumoribus <i.e. of
disasters to Louis IX) prophetiam abbatis Ioachim quidam reduxerunt ad
