152 Friar Henry of W odstone and the Jews

Redburn (Co. Herts.), which Cok had of the gift of
Geoffrey of Childewyk, was confirmed by Letters Patent. 1

It appears from these entries that Geoffrey was still
alive 1n January 1271, but he seems to have died soon
afterwards, and before the Abbot had bought out the Jew.
For Walsingham continues: Geoffrey, dying, left his
brother Henry his heir 3 ² Henry transferred all his rights
in Childewyk to his younger brother Richard, and Richard
fully enfeoffed the Jew with it, “ to the disinheritance of

and expensive lawsuit ensued, in which the Abbot was
successful, in spite of the opposition of Queen Eleanor
(who made a claim to the manor)3 and of many other
powerful people, blinded by bribes, fear or favour. “ It
may indeed be held that God sent his angel to prove our
truth. At that very time a Friar Minor named Henry of
Wodstone came unexpectedly to our aid . . . and,
proving our claims and overthrowing the presumption of
our adversaries, reverently and wisely turned the hearts
of many to the justice of our cause.''

The general question as to the right of the Jews to
hold manors, with the incidents of wardship, marriage,
advowsons, etc., was, according to the Liber de antiquis
legibus,4 raised at this time by a petition from the Jews to
the King and Council, and the claim was almost conceded
by some of the members of the Council, under the
influence of bribes. But a Friar Minor came before the
King and Council and argued against the proposal so
vigorously and successfully that a statute was made

forbidding Jews to own freeholds.
